## üá¨üáß Edwic.Dash: Your MQTT Dashboard in the Browser

**Edwic.Dash** is a modern, fast, and beautiful dashboard for monitoring and controlling your MQTT devices. Its key feature is its **"Frontend-Only"** architecture: the entire application runs directly in your browser, with no backend required.

### üöÄ What is this for?

**Edwic.Dash** is designed as a lightweight and simple solution for visualizing and controlling MQTT devices. It's the perfect tool if you:
*   Want a fast and intuitive interface for your existing MQTT infrastructure.
*   Use devices compatible with **Home Assistant MQTT Discovery** (e.g., ESPHome, Zigbee2MQTT).
*   Don't need complex automations on the dashboard side, but rather a convenient "remote control."
*   Value autonomy, as all your configuration is stored locally in your browser.

### ‚ú® Key Features

*   **Frontend-Only Architecture**: No server-side backend needed. The app connects directly to your MQTT broker via WebSockets.
*   **Home Assistant MQTT Discovery Support**: Automatically discovers and adds new devices.
*   **Highly Customizable Dashboards**:
    *   Create and manage multiple independent dashboards.
    *   Use a flexible grid to drag, drop, and resize widgets.
*   **Essential Widgets**:
    *   **Sensor:** Displays data and its value history.
    *   **Switch:** Sends `ON`/`OFF` commands.
    *   **Climate:** Controls the temperature and modes of climate devices.
*   **Configuration Management**: Easily export and import your entire setup to a `.json` file.
*   **Cross-Platform**: Run it as a web app, via Docker, or as a native Android app.
